          <strong>Achievement percentiles</strong> compare your child to other
          students nationwide. <strong>Growth percentiles</strong> measure how
          much your child learned compared to other students who started at the
          same level. Both matter, but for different reasons.

          <strong>Both metrics matter.</strong> High achievement with low growth
          suggests your child needs more challenge. Low achievement with high
          growth indicates effective support that should continue. Use
          achievement to understand where your child stands and growth to
          evaluate whether they're moving forward at an appropriate pace.

          Growth percentiles can fluctuate more than achievement percentiles. A
          single low growth score isn't cause for alarmâ€”look for patterns over
          multiple testing periods. For deeper score interpretation, see our{" "}
