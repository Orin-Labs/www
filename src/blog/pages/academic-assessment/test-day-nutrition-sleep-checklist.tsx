          Quality sleep and proper nutrition directly impact cognitive function,
          memory consolidation, and stress management. Small changes in the week
          leading up to testing can significantly improve your child's
          performance and confidence.

        <p>
          Don't make dramatic changes to sleep or eating habits right before
          testing. Consistency is more important than perfection. If your child
          has trouble sleeping, focus on relaxation techniques rather than sleep
          aids.

      <Alert type="success" title="The Bottom Line" icon={CheckCircle}>
        <p>
          Good preparation reduces test anxiety naturally. When your child feels
          physically ready, they can focus on demonstrating what they know
          rather than fighting fatigue or hunger. These strategies work best
          when combined with{" "}
