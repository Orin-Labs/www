        <p>
          MAP RIT scores and state tests measure similar skills but use
          different scales. Converting helps you understand how your student
          might perform on state assessments and identify areas for focused
          preparation.

      >
        <p>
          MAP tests and state assessments both measure academic achievement, but
          they use different scoring systems. RIT scores provide a consistent
          scale across grade levels, while state tests typically use performance
          levels like "Proficient" or "Advanced."
        </p>

        <p>
          The conversion process uses statistical correlations between MAP RIT
          scores and state test performance. While these predictions are helpful
          for planning, remember that actual state test results depend on many
          factors including test preparation, format differences, and your
          student's readiness on test day.

          While test scores provide valuable information, they're just one piece
          of your student's academic picture. Focus on growth over time,
          celebrate progress, and use these tools to support your student's
          learning journey. Every student learns differently, and success comes
          in many forms.
