Effective Date: November 19, 2024

We value your privacy and make every effort to respect your wishes and personal
information. Please read this policy carefully to understand how we collect,
use, and manage your phone numbers.

## COLLECTION OF PHONE NUMBERS

We collect your phone numbers only when you voluntarily provide them to us, for
example, during transactions, inquiries, or when you sign up for our promotional
messages. You can opt in to receive these SMS messages by providing your phone
number during our onboarding process.

## USE OF PHONE NUMBERS FOR SMS

Your phone numbers are primarily used to provide you with notifications when
training is due, and can be used to reply if you have questions about specific
training materials. SMS messaging charges may be applied by your carrier. We
will only share your phone number with our SMS provider, subject to their
privacy policy.

## OPTING OUT OF MARKETING MESSAGES

If at any time you wish to stop receiving messages from us, you can opt out by
texting STOP.

## PRIVACY OF PHONE NUMBERS

Once you have opted out, we will not send you any more SMS messages, nor will we sell or transfer your phone number to another party.

## CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

We may periodically update this policy. We will notify you about significant
changes in the way we treat your information by placing a prominent notice on
our site.

We thank you for your understanding and cooperation. If you have any questions
or concerns about this policy, please feel free to contact us via the form on
our site.
