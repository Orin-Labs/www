    question: "How do I interpret my child's RIT scores?",
    answer:
      "RIT scores are on a stable scale typically ranging from 140-300. For middle school, expect scores between 200-250. The key is understanding that RIT scores show absolute achievement‚Äîwhat your child actually knows‚Äîrather than just comparing them to others. Growth in RIT scores over time is more important than any single score.",

  },
  {
    question: "Why does my child sometimes score lower on MAP tests?",
    answer:
      "MAP tests are designed to be challenging‚Äîstudents typically get about 50% of questions correct. This isn't failure; it's the adaptive system finding their optimal difficulty level. Factors like test conditions, student motivation, curriculum changes, or natural learning curves can affect scores.",
    icon: "brain",
  },
  {
    question: "How do MAP scores connect to state testing?",
    answer:
      "MAP scores often predict state test performance because they measure similar skills. Schools often use MAP data to: identify students who may need additional support before state testing, adjust instruction to address learning gaps, and celebrate growth and achievement throughout the year. The ongoing nature of MAP testing provides more actionable data than annual state assessments.",
    icon: "brain",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I be concerned if my child's scores went down?",
    answer:
      "Not necessarily. Score fluctuations can happen due to various factors including test conditions, student motivation, or curriculum changes. Look at trends over multiple testing windows rather than single scores. Sometimes a temporary dip precedes significant growth as students tackle more challenging material.",
    icon: "brain",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I support my child's MAP performance at home?",
    answer:
      "Focus on consistent academic support rather than test prep. Encourage regular reading across genres, practice math facts for fluency, support homework completion, and create a learning-focused home environment. The best preparation is quality instruction and engagement throughout the year.",
    icon: "brain",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between achievement and growth?",
    answer:
      "Achievement shows where your student is right now compared to grade-level expectations, while growth shows how much they've improved over time. A student starting below grade level but showing consistent growth is often on a stronger trajectory than one who starts high but plateaus.",
    icon: "brain",
  },
  {
    question: "How often are MAP tests given?",
    answer:
      "Most schools administer MAP tests 2-3 times per year (fall, winter, spring). This frequency allows tracking of growth over time and helps teachers adjust instruction. The tests typically take 45-60 minutes per subject.",
    icon: "brain",
  },
  {
    question: "Can students retake MAP tests?",
    answer:
      "MAP tests are typically administered on set school schedules, and individual retakes aren't standard practice. However, speak with your child's teacher about additional assessment options or ways to demonstrate growth between testing periods.",

      <BlogSection title="What is MAP Testing?">
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) is a computer-adaptive assessment
          created by NWEA (Northwest Evaluation Association) that measures
          student growth in reading, language usage, and mathematics. Unlike
          traditional tests where every student answers the same questions, MAP
          testing adapts to your child's responses‚Äîif they answer correctly, the
          next question becomes slightly more challenging; if they answer
          incorrectly, the next question becomes easier.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This adaptive approach provides a more accurate picture of what your
          student knows and is ready to learn next, regardless of their grade
          level. Think of it as a personalized academic GPS that shows exactly
          where your child stands and where they're headed.

      {/* Growth vs Achievement */}
      <BlogSection title="Growth vs. Achievement">
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          One of the most important concepts for parents to understand is the
          difference between achievement and growth. Achievement tells you where
          your student is right now compared to grade-level expectations, while
          growth tells you how much they've improved over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          A student who starts the year significantly below grade level but
          shows consistent growth throughout the year is demonstrating
          remarkable progress, even if their final score isn't at grade level.
          Conversely, a student who starts above grade level but shows little
          growth may need additional challenges or support.
        </p>
        <p>
          MAP testing excels at measuring growth because it uses the same scale
          across all grade levels. This means you can track your student's
          progress year after year, seeing their academic journey unfold in
          real-time.

          While MAP testing provides ongoing insights into your student's
          progress, state tests serve a different purpose. State assessments are
          typically administered once per year and measure whether students are
          meeting state standards for their grade level.
