# Orin

**We spend 3% of global GDP on teaching,** and AI is going to eat it.

**It is now possible to truly scale _personalized teaching_ to every student.** Whether it comes direct to consumer or through institutions, there will exist a software layer responsible for teaching our children. Whoever can build that layer will be in command of one of the most valuable industries on Earth.

**To start, we’re launching an AI private tutor named Orin for the $100B private tutoring market.** We manage the full learning journey on behalf of parents - how to benchmark a student, how to track progress, and how to teach them best. Parents place responsibility on us and families are waiting to onboard at $150/mo.

We're backed by early engineers from Clever as well as the founders of Roboflow, Upright, and more. **If you’d like to invest or work with us, we'd love to hear from you.**
