In the next 5-10 years, AI is going to completely change how we think about education. **It is now possible to truly scale _personalized_ _teaching_ to every student.** Whether it comes direct to consumer or through public/private institutions, there will exist a software layer responsible for teaching our children. Whoever can build that layer will be in command of one of the most valuable industries on Earth.

This problem has plagued me for more than half of my life. Ever since entering a rural middle school I was petitioning school boards and convincing superintendents to let me learn the things the school wasn’t staffed to offer.

Not only is this a personal problem, but I’m also uniquely suited to solve it. I was in high school five years ago - I experienced the changes that COVID brought to student-life first hand. Yet I’ve also been in startups for years. I’ve built products and teams 0 to 1, helped scale companies to millions in revenue, and have failed plenty.

**Building this is very hard**. Existing models are fantastic, but they are only the building blocks of the product we’re making. Designing a system that can take responsibility for a student's learning for years is no small feat. But with the right team, it’s doable.

**I’ve been pulling together some of my most talented friends from companies like Clever, Khan Academy, Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, Palantir, and more.** I’ve been talking to dozens of families and collected hundreds of dollars in payments for fragmented demo versions of the product.

**To start, we’re building an AI private tutor named Orin for the $100B private tutoring market.** This will set a high bar for the educational parts of the product — if it isn’t effective, people won’t buy. We’ll be forced to build the hardest part of the product, an effective teacher, first. I have 25 families waiting to onboard once it's built.

Once we have an effective teaching system and a growing consumer tutoring business, we’ll launch into schools, giving teachers the ability to deploy a personalized, one-to-one AI teacher for every student in their classroom.

I'm already backed by founders of Roboflow, Upright, and early engineers at Clever. If you’d like to invest or work with us, I’d love to hear from you.
