# Orin

I’m [Bryan Houlton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-houlton/), a solo founder building [Orin](https://www.learnwithorin.com/) - a drop-in AI replacement for human tutors.

Orin books lessons, interfaces with parents, teaches students one-on-one, creates curriculum & homework assignments, and more. I built a demo for the SAT tutoring market and have a handful of users who use it multiple times per week, one paying $150/mo.

I’m a college dropout and second time founder (ex-YC) whose first company was acqui-hired.

## Product

When buying a tutor, parents want:

1. **A proactive tutor**, not a responsive one. ChatGPT is smart, but you have to pull information out like a textbook. Orin will proactively push information, lessons, and homework to your student.
2. **An accountable tutor**. Your kid didn’t show up for a lesson? We’ll notify you. Curious how your kid is doing? Just call or text Orin. Orin himself is the interface, just like a human tutor would be.
3. **A flexible tutor**. Something came up today? Text us and move your lesson to tomorrow. Your kid has sports after school until 8pm every day and would prefer to study at night? No problem.
4. **An effective tutor**. Do you trust his abilities? Is he correct and relevant? Can he manage a long-term learning plan?

Orin is closer to a human tutor than a software platform. All of our marketing, design, and product work is geared around this.

The end goal is not to build a cheaper tutor, but a _better_ one. He just also happens to be cheaper.

## Timing

Before the rise of intelligent AI models, you simply couldn’t build this kind of product. No amount of Khan Academy quizzes is equivalent to a human tutor, so willingness to pay for that was low.

Now, software can handle an increasing level of ambiguity and edge cases. Products can be built to be more accountable, which is what people pay for.

## Traction

A few weeks ago I soft-launched the product and got a customer paying $150/mo and using it 2-3x/wk. He’s not a friend of mine, just a random 11th grader whose dad found a post I put out.

In the past week I removed the price tag and ~10 students have signed up. It’s clear that students prefer Orin over a real tutor. Even with a _very rough_ experience with the early version of the platform, they keep trying to come back. I’ve also noticed an uptick in activity at night and on weekends.

## Market

The American private tutoring market by itself is ~$25B (50M kids, 10% receive tutoring, ~$400/mo). Globally, it’s closer to $125B—still based on an hourly model. Moving to a subscription model will make the market much larger.

Additionally, I’ll be the only company to have deep, contextual data on what a kid knows, how they learn, and what they’re good at. There’s a billion fun uses for this data at scale, so estimating total market size is tough.

## Competition

Most consumer edtech companies (Khan Academy, Udemy, etc) are scaled content distributors. But with the rise of AI, content itself is a dying moat. Instead, the next wave of edtech companies will be the ones specifically geared towards _teaching_, since you’re more closely aligned with the student's outcome.

Our competition is mostly human tutoring aggregated by companies like:

- [Kaplan](https://www.kaptest.com/sat/courses/sat-tutoring), who sells non-personalized group prep courses for $1.7k-$6k
- [C2 Education](https://www.c2educate.com/locations/west-portal-san-francisco-ca/), who does hourly [3-on-1 tutoring](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/195dq0g/c2_education/) for $60/hr

There are many other localized tutoring offerings. Most are $60+/hr for one-on-one, or $1k+ for group prep classes. Orin behaves like the human tutors, but charges monthly.

## Distribution & Financials

When I ask users what they would consider too cheap or too expensive for tutoring, they answer in $/hr. So there's significant pricing flexibility. We picked $150/mo because that's high enough to ensure that we're only targeting users who would be willing to pay for tutoring, but low enough that we're not pricing out the majority of the market.

With a price of $150/mo and low marginal cost, we can spend an absurd amount of money on CAC and still get a near-instant payback. Based on some initial ad runs, cost per sign up is going to be $40-50. Sign up → paid account conversion is still unclear, but I estimate a total CAC of <$200.

Word of mouth is a powerful channel in tutoring. We can offer cash referrals to students or parents and still be LTV-positive.

Our projected LTV is still unknown. Ideally, we’ll prioritize markets with longer LTVs, meaning that SAT might actually be the wrong place to start. Either way, it seems that CAC will get paid back almost instantly given the high price.

## Moats

Just like a real tutor, Orin will get better the more you work with him.

He’ll figure out that you like visual explanations in math topics, but learn fast when diving into examples for science. Orin can spend hundreds of man-hours per week on a single kid behind the scenes, crafting the best next lesson or homework assignment specifically for them.

This entrenchment makes it tough to switch. You’ll have to rebuild context somewhere else for a competitor to work as well. You can already see this moat in human tutors, but we can actually scale it.

## Raise

If you decide to invest in Orin, you're making two bets:

1. You're betting that the adage of _"edtech doesn't pay"_ is no longer true. It's clear that people pay for education, but before AI, the tech couldn't deliver. We believe that now it can, and are showing that the willingness to pay is actually very high for consumers.
2. You're making a product bet. It's clear that the market is large and pre-paradigmatic, so the primary risk is execution. Users want this and are willing to pay for it - we just need to build it.

To mitigate that risk, I’m raising a seed round of $3M on SAFEs at a $18M post-money valuation cap to build out the team. I’ve lined up a couple friends from places like Khan Academy, Clever, Palantir, and Citadel that I’d like to aggressively pursue after closing the round.
