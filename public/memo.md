Tutoring is a product that already has PMF.

The American private tutoring market makes $25B annually, and the world-wide market is closer to $125B. This market spans general tutoring, career specific tutoring, test prep services, and more, with the average tutor costing $40-80/hr—even more for specialized topic areas.

It’s an incredibly simple product in concept, yet extremely difficult in execution.

When you buy tutoring services, you’re rarely buying information. You used to be, but not anymore. Everything a tutor will teach you is available, for free, and only one Google search away.

So why do we still spend so much money on tutoring?

It turns out, tutors are more than just almanacs. It’s not the content that’s important anymore—it’s the _teaching_.

Tutors need to be able to manage schedules, hold students accountable, and provide relevant lesson content or resources. Tutors have to be empathetic, manage parents, plan for the long-term, and have curricular opinions.

Ultimately, we pay tutors to be responsible for our learning journeys. We want to feel confident that we’re making progress in the right direction, guided by the wisdom of an expert.

Existing edtech products don’t offer this. If you look closely at Khan Academy, Duolingo, Udemy, or Coursera, you’ll find that these companies are actually content providers! They have issues scaling because they can’t solve the one problem we actually buy tutors for. Instead, they act as interactive textbooks.

Before this year, building a replacement for tutors was impossible. Models weren’t good enough teachers, voices were stuck in the uncanny valley, and managing a long-term learning plan was too difficult to scale.

Now, everything has changed. Models are getting smarter and cheaper every day, Sesame’s voices have just crossed the uncanny valley, and we’re better than ever at building ambitious application-layer technology.

Yet we still pay hourly for a tutor.

In the past two months I’ve shipped two demo experiments of my tutor, Orin, to students—some students even paid $150/mo and engaged for four hours every week. From these experiments, I learned a few things:

- **Willingness to pay is extremely high if you build the right product**. Charging $150/mo seemed low to most users—they’re already paying more for alternatives.
- **With the right product, the distribution is quickly profitable**. CAC seems to be around $100-$150, which will get paid back immediately. My marketing is competing with local tutoring businesses who have worse margins, so there are clear open channels.
- **The product that people want to pay for is very ambitious.**
  - Students prefer voice agents, but we need to rebuild the current in-lesson experience.
  - We need to build a long-term memory to help students navigate their learning journeys over months or years.
  - We need to build a database of content that can be used in lessons or homework assignments, and be able to handle scheduling edge cases.

This is a huge opportunity, and someone is going to go after it soon. The existing adage of “_edtech doesn’t pay_” is over, but the world doesn’t realize yet.

I’m committed to being the first mover and am raising $2M on SAFEs at an $18M post.

Specifically, I’d like to hire a few of my smartest engineering friends from places like Khan Academy, Clever, Palantir, and Citadel to speed up the development. This is the sci-fi idea that education-minded engineers have been dreaming to build.

The product that people want is very clear and there’s a pathway to building it—it’d just take me way to long to do alone.

The first company to build this is going to win a $100B market.

Interested in being a part of it? I’d love to hear from you.
